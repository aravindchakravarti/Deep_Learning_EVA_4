In this project, the Goal is to achieve 99.4% accuracy with less than 10k Parameter. Lets build the network sequentially and see if can achieve our target.

Lets try these things first.

# Try 1:
## Target
* Make code more 'Readable' by adding some visualizers. Such as, Training and Test accuracy plots.
* Use drop out and check the accuracy.

## Result
* I didn't hit the required accuracy
* On an average test accuracy was around 98.7%
* Around 13k parameters

## Analysis
* By looking at the plot we can say that, there no over-fitting. But, training and test accuarcy plot is not very smooth. That means learning rate is too high at the end.
* Probably, after GAP, I may need to add 1x1x10 and then what happens. Because, after GAP, we are allowed to add FC, as we know, by the time of GAP, more or less, we have class label data.

# Try 2:
## Target
* After GAP, add a FC
* Hit <10k parameter
* Do have the accuracy at-least 98%

## Result
* Successfully added FC after GAP
* 9772 parameters
* Accuracy = 98.95 in last epoch (rough average)

## Analysis
* Decreasing learning helped to smoothen the curves (<- It is a good sign)
* Even with <10k parametes, hitting 98.95% accuracy is good. But not enough to hit 99.4%
* Next step is to use master tool -> Augmentation!!
